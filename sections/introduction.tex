Our two contributions for crowd-sensing platforms are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Foug\`ere, a data dissemination library that uses a distance notion to disseminate data.
	The library comes with 3 defaults dissemination modules: Wi-Fi Direct, Social and Contextual.
	\item AndroFleet, a large-scale emulation platform that includes a WiFi-Direct emulation implementation for the Android platform. 
	This emulation platform is a tool that permits the testing of crowd-sensing applications in the context of a crowd of devices. 
	AndroFleet trends to be as near as possible to the real usage of the application on real mobile devices.
\end{itemize}

The reminder of this paper is structured as follows. In Section \ref{sec:context_motivation} we introduce the context and motivations that remain to this work. Section \ref{sec:contribution} presents the principles used by the Foug\`ere library. Section \ref{sec:implementation_details} describes important points of Foug\`ere. Then, in the Section \ref{sec:evaluation} we present AndroFleet and the results of the contribution. Finally, in Section \ref{sec:conclusion_perspectives} we summarize and discuss future possible works.
