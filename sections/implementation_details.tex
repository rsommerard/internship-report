Our solution targets the Android Operating System.
We choose Android because it is the most popular and open-source platform for mobile that is currently available.
Android provides an implementation of the Wi-Fi Direct technology that we use to disseminate data between users.

\subsection{Wi-Fi Direct}

As exposed on the Figure~\ref{WiFiVsWiFiDi}, where (a) the Wi-Fi working technology and (b) the Wi-Fi Direct working technology, this last allows to connect two devices together without the requirement of an Access Point.
The Wi-Fi Direct uses peer-to-peer connection types--devices communicate directly together.
We choose the Wi-Fi Direct technology for our proximity dissemination because it covers a wider area than other proximity technologies like the Bluetooth (e.g., Wi-Fi Direct range is more than 600 feet contrary to Bluetooth that is at least 200 feet).
Furthermore, the Wi-Fi Direct technology offers speeds of up to 250 Mbps while Bluetooth is around 25 Mbps.

Before establishing a connection, a device must discover its environment to know if another device is available.
During the discovery process, a device sends regularly a signal that informs about its presence.
The Android Wi-Fi Direct implementation provides the Domain Name System Service Discovery (DNS-SD) protocol that permit to discover other device services that are within range.
This DNS-SD broadcast a set of key/value information that can be read by other devices.
For instance, a broadcast can contain information about the port that will be used to exchange data, the name of the service that is provided, etc.
Devices that are in discovery mode can then filter devices and choose devices that correspond to their connection requirement.
In our implementation, the discovery process is running until the Wi-Fi Direct module is stopped or the Wi-Fi connection is disabled on the device.

After a connection is established between two devices, a private network is created to allow communication through sockets.
The time to establish a connection is about 3 to 5 seconds, but can take up to 2 minutes in the worst cases.
To prevent eventual issues, we set up a timeout to 1 minute per connection.
After this time, device connected or not, the Wi-Fi Direct instance is reset and a new one is instantiated.
The particularity of Wi-Fi Direct communication is that one device on the network is named Group Owner (GO).
The GO is unique for a specific connection and it is the only one that knows all other devices in the private network.
The other connected devices are named Client.
The clients cannot communicate directly with other devices connected to the private network.
They can only communicate with the GO.

This drawback in communication is not embarrassing in our case because we consider that a device can be connected and communicate with only one other device at a time.
In our case, we consider that a device is connected to a single device at a time.
A connection is only made between two devices, no more.
Our implementation does not request for a connection with a device that is already connected with another.
In our implementation, when a connection is successfully processed, each device sends his shared data and add the device to an ephemeral history.
A device is kept in the history an hour to prevent multiple sending of the same data to the same data.

The Wi-Fi Direct implementation requires a user interaction the first time where two devices try to connect each others.
This user's acknowledgement can be seen as a drawback in an opportunistic networking because it cuts the flow of hidden interactions between each device, but this interaction requested only the first time a connection is made between two devices.
If the user accepts the connection request, the following connection with the same device will be automatic and do not ask again for user interaction until the next system reboot or Wi-Fi Direct cleaning groups.
A cleaning function that automatically removes the Wi-Fi Direct groups each time the Wi-Fi Direct is started.
We think that the user acknowledgment is important because it enhances the privacy awareness of the user by informing him that his data will be exchanged with another device.

For more details about this technology, a good study made by Conti et al.~\cite{DBLP:conf/wd/ContiDMP13} present specificity of Wi-Fi Direct connections.

\subsection{Peer Sampling Service}

%%%% END OK

We provide our dissemination solution as a library that can be used in applications that required a data dissemination layer before sending data to a server.

The single requirement is to initialize a Foug\`ere Object.
By default, the 3 modules are enabled: Wi-Fi Direct, Social and Contextual.

It is possible to disable module or add new one.
We provide the Disseminator interface that enable developer to implement his own disseminator.
The requirements induced by the Disseminator interface is the weight that will be used to calculate the data repartition.
