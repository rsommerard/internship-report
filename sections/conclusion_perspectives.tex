Future work can implement a k-anonymity 

k-anonymity decentralized implementation: share data only if other data of the same campaign are seen for example.



Improvement can be made in Foug\`ere by studying treat and counter them.
Take concern of what type of data is sended and adapt parameters like TTL or what kind of dissemination use.

Add a seen value to data to remote data to server only when we seen a Data an X number of time.

Improvement can be made on the AndroFleet emulator tools by adding more emulation part like Bluetooth or Wi-Fi hotspot.
Providing dataset pre-builded to be run in the emulator to offer comparable result.
Rework on the Wi-Fi Direct implementation by making Android pre-build image providing WiFi-Direct included in the image. By including it directly in the Android framework.
This will enable no source code refactor to be able to test an application.
Just put an apk in a directory and run. 


Use the lib with APISENSE to test his viability in the real world.
